* System reliability bounds for arbitrarily complex system layouts
* Nonparametric modelling of component reliability functions
* Vague and partial specification of prior component reliability functions possible
* Wider reliability bounds on component and system level in case of prior-data conflict
* Freely available and easy to use software: implemented in R package ReliabilityTheory
